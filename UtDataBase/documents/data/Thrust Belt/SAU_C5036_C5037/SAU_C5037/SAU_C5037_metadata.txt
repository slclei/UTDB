  Description:
    Abstract: The storage assessment unit (SAU) is the fundamental unit used in the National Assessment of Geologic Carbon Dioxide Storage Resources project for the assessment of geologic CO2 storage resources. The SAU is shown here as a geographic boundary interpreted, defined, and mapped by the geologist responsible for the assessment interval. Individual storage SAUs are defined on the basis of common geologic and hydrologic characteristics. The resource that is assessed is the mass of CO2 that can be stored in the technically accessible pore volume of a storage formation. The technically accessible storage resource is one that may be available using present-day geological and engineering knowledge and technology for CO2 injection into geologic formations and therefore is not a total in-place resource estimate. The SAU boundary is defined geologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the SAU, such as limits of reservoir rock, geologic structures, depth, and seal lithologies. The only exceptions to this are SAUs that border the international, or Federal-State water boundary. In these cases, the international or Federal-State water boundary forms part of the SAU boundary.
    Purpose: The purpose of these files is to define and illustrate the geographic extent and geologic boundaries of the storage assessment units within the sedimentary basin, as required for the  National Assessment of Geologic Carbon Dioxide Storage Resources project. In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act (Public Law 110-140; URL <http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/07/08/2010-16236/energy-independence-and-security-act-pub-l-110-140>) authorized the USGS to conduct a national assessment of geologic storage resources for CO2. The storage assessment units were used as the fundamental units for the assessment of CO2 geologic storage resources.
    Supplemental_Information: Carbon dioxide storage assessment units within province C5037 (Greater Green River Basin) are listed below in Stratum Keywords by storage assessment unit name. The storage assessment unit boundaries define the combined geologic limits of each storage assessment unit and are described and defined in the text of the basin description publication. See Buursink and others (2014) for a description of how individual assessments were drawn; also see Brennan and others (2010) for a description on the USGS CO2 storage assessment methodology.

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The storage assessment unit coverage is based on geological expertise and is as accurate as possible. The nine-digit number identifies the USGS-specific storage assessment unit. The preceding letter "C" refers to a carbon dioxide storage assessment unit and distinguishes it from USGS National Oil and Gas Assessment Project assessment units that may have similar numbers. The first digit after "C" of the code indicates the world region number (5), the following three digits (037) are the North America province number, the following two digits (C5037xx) are the basin number, and the last two digits (C503701xx) are the storage assessment unit number of that particular basin. For more detailed description of how the storage assessment unit boundary was drawn, refer to the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah section of the Open-File Report by Buursink and others (2014).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Wells that have penetrated formations of interest in the Greater Green River Basin were retrieved from IHS Energy Group, WHCS database for wells (downloaded Jan 20, 2011, from IHS ENERDEQ), and Nehring Associates, Inc., Significant Oil and Gas Field File (2008 update). The boundaries of the storage assessment units were determined by the Greater Green River Basin Assessment team and were drawn on the basis of geologic characteristics and conditions favorable for carbon dioxide storage, such as reservoir characteristics, depth, water quality, seal rocks, and trapping mechanisms, that combine to distinguish SAUs from each other.

  Logical_Consistency_Report: The storage assessment unit coverage was reviewed at multiple stages by the geologists and geographic information specialists. The storage assessment unit boundaries were checked for their geographic extent and compared to other storage assessment unit boundaries within their basin. Attribute tables and projections were also checked and are as accurate as possible.
  Completeness_Report: The storage assessment unit was mapped in part on the data contained in the IHS Energy Group, WHCS database for wells (downloaded Jan 20, 2011, from IHS ENERDEQ), and the Nehring Associates, Inc., Significant Oil and Gas Field File (2008 update). The Nehring file has production through December 2008. There is a lag time between the data vintage and the publication date.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The storage assessment unit boundary represents the gross boundary of the combined geologic elements that comprise the storage assessment unit. The boundaries of the storage assessment units were determined by the Greater Green River Basin Assessment Team, and were drawn on the basis of geologic characteristics and conditions favorable for carbon dioxide storage, such as reservoir characteristics, depth, water quality, seal rocks, and trapping mechanisms, that combine to distinguish SAUs from each other. In many cases the boundary was defined by consulting well data or existing paper copies of digital maps. Transformation of data from the data sources may have introduced errors in horizontal accuracy. The interval geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each storage assessment unit in a formal geologic and storage assessment unit review meeting. The lateral position of the SAU boundary is generally considered to be accurate to plus or minus (+/-) 10 percent of the area defined by the SAU boundary. If the geologist is uncertain about the position of the boundary, a greater variation percentage may be used. The percentage of this uncertainty is recorded on the assessment input form that will be published with the SAU assessment results.
