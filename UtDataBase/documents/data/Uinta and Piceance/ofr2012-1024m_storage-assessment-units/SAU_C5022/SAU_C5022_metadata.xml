The SAU is shown here as a geographic boundary interpreted, defined, and mapped by the geologist responsible for the assessment interval. Individual SAUs are defined on the basis of common geologic and hydrologic characteristics. The resource that is assessed is the mass of CO2 that can be stored in the technically accessible pore volume of a storage formation. The technically accessible storage resource is one that may be available using present-day geological and engineering knowledge and technology for CO2 injection into geologic formations and therefore is not a total in-place resource estimate. The SAU boundary is defined geologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the SAU, such as limits of reservoir rock, geologic structures, depth, and seal lithologies. The only exceptions to this are SAUs that border the international, or Federal-State water boundary. In these cases, the international or Federal-State water boundary forms part of the SAU boundary.</abstract><purpose>The purpose of these files is to define and illustrate the geographic extent and geologic boundaries of the storage assessment units within the sedimentary basin, as required for the National Assessment of Geologic Carbon Dioxide Storage Resources project. In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act (Public Law 110-140; URL &lt;http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/07/08/2010-16236/energy-independence-and-security-act-pub-l-110-140&gt;) authorized the USGS to conduct a national assessment of geologic storage resources for CO2. The storage assessment units were used as the fundamental units for the assessment of CO2 geologic storage resources.</purpose><supplinf>Carbon dioxide storage assessment units within province C5022 (San Juan Basin) are listed below in Stratum Keywords by storage assessment unit name. The storage assessment unit boundaries define the combined geologic limits of each storage assessment unit and are described and defined in the text of the basin description publication. See Merrill and others (2016) for a description of how individual assessments were drawn; also see Brennan and others (2010) for a description on the USGS CO2 storage assessment methodology.

The boundaries of the storage assessment units were determined by the San Juan Basin Assessment Team, and were drawn on the basis of geologic characteristics and conditions favorable for carbon dioxide storage, such as reservoir characteristics, depth, water quality, seal rocks, and trapping mechanisms, that combine to distinguish SAUs from each other. In many cases the boundary was defined by consulting well data or existing paper copies of digital maps. Transformation of data from the data sources may have introduced errors in horizontal accuracy. The interval geologist was required to defend the geologic boundaries of each storage assessment unit in a formal geologic and storage assessment unit review meeting. The lateral position of the SAU boundary is generally considered to be accurate to plus or minus (+/-) 10 percent of the area defined by the SAU boundary. If the geologist is uncertain about the position of the boundary, a greater variation percentage may be used. The percentage of this uncertainty is recorded on the assessment input form that will be published with the SAU assessment results.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>IHS Energy Group</origin><pubdate>20110120</pubdate><title>IHS Enerdeq U.S. well data</title><geoform>tabular digital data</geoform><pubinfo><pubplace>Englewood, Colorado, U.S.A. </pubplace><publish>IHS Energy Group</publish></pubinfo><onlink>&lt;http://www.ihs.com/products/oil-gas-information/data-access/enerdeq/browser.aspx&gt;</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20110120</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>Well data</srccitea><srccontr>Source of all well records used to determine the depth and extent of specific SAUs.</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Nehring Associates, Inc.</origin><pubdate>2010</pubdate><title>The significant oil and gas fields of the United States</title><geoform>tabular digital data</geoform><pubinfo><pubplace>Colorado Springs, CO</pubplace><publish>Nehring Associates, Inc.</publish></pubinfo><onlink>&lt;http://www.nehringdatabase.com/&gt;</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2010</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>Reservoir data</srccitea><srccontr>Reservoir depths were used to help define the extent of the SAU boundary.</srccontr><typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>Wells that have penetrated formations of interest in the San Juan Basin were retrieved from IHS Energy Group (2011), WHCS database for wells (downloaded Jan 20, 2011, from the IHS ENERDEQ database), and Nehring Associates, Inc., Significant Oil and Gas Field File (2008 update).
